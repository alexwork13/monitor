script used psutil library, wich installed:
  pip install psutil
we can run this script with two parameters (cpu | mem)
if we input another text - we will see the message, which notifies about it.

In the Dockerfile run this script (Sory, I have beginner knowledge with docker, so now I can't answer for some questions. 
But its a very interest task for me, and when I have more free time I will make it )

Thank you for your attention =)
